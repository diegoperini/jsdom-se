# jsdom-se (jsdom silent errors)

This is a fork of the original [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) that is modified to disable crashes caused by giving string arguments to timer functions. If original jsdom will someday provide this functionality, this package will be removed from npm. New changes towards silencing runtime errors may be introduced in this package in the future. Contributions/suggestions/criticism are accepted.
